# SAMovies.Droid
[not completed] Android app as a project for the Software Arcitecture course during my Erasmus+ Exchange at Vilnius University

An incomplete android project which was written as an assignment during my erasmus exchange at Vilnius University.
It uses Retrofit and okhttp to consume our api https://github.com/amoraitis/SAMoviesAPI, which stores each userÂ´s data(also written by us) and an api to consume data about movies(http://api.themoviedb.org/3/).
